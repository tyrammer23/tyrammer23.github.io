            <h1>A little about me</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Tyler and I am an Informatics major.  
                I was a Computer Science major for my first 3 years here at ASU.
                Outside of school, I enjoy playing hockey, reading, coding, and hiking.
                My goal is to be well-acquainted with all areas in developing and 
                testing software. Though it is definitely important to be highly specialized 
                in some area of your field, I also believe it is important to be knowledgeable
                in as many areas as you can in order to gain various insights and
                strategies to be a better problem-solver.
